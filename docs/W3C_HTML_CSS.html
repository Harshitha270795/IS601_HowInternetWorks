            <h4>W3C</h4>
             Back in the day when the Internet was just introduced, there were few standards for coding, page design, and
            browser compatibility. Many different web browsers competed for market dominance. And with the lack of
            standards, most websites did not work well with all browsers. If you needed information from a web site that
            didn’t work on your browser, you either had to buy a different browser or get that information
            elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then in 1994 Tim Berners - Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C. W3C is an international
                community of member organizations that sets web standards so that websites look and work the same in all
                web browsers. W3C compliance basically means that the HTML and CSS code that a website is built with is
                fully compliant with the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium.
            </p>
            <h4> HTML</h4>
            <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage

            <p>HTML is the language used to build Web sites (pages). HTML uses standard codes, or tags, to determine
            how a Web page looks when your browser displays it. HTML tags also display the hyperlinks that connect
                information on the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <h4> CSS</h4>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the layout tool used for specifying how a web site looks. When you go to
                a page and see a navigation bar, a footer and images embedded in a news article with text wrapping
                around them it was CSS that made that happen. This is a really critical thing to remember. CSS defines
                the look of a page whereas HTML structures and gives meaning to content.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-justify">The payload section of a packet contains the actual data being transferred. This is often just a small part of a file, webpage, or other transmission, since individual packets are relatively small. For example, the maximum size of an IP packet payload is 65,535 bytes, or 64 kilobytes. The maximum size of an Ethernet packet or "frame" is only 1,500 bytes or 1.5 kilobytes.Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully. If a packet is not received or is "dropped," only the dropped packet needs to be resent. Additionally, if a data transfer encounters network congestion due to multiple simultaneous transfers, the remaining packets can be rerouted through a less congested path.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-left">Routers and Routing:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Routers got their name because they route IP Packets across networks: a router device connects different links. It examines IP packet headers, looking at the destination address and consulting a routing table of known networks. The table indicates which connections to send the packet on as the next link. The connections on a router are called interfaces: through the router, they interface between different link types.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-justify">In the image, an IP packet arrives at a router, which compares the packet’s destination address with the networks in the routing table. The packet is identified as belonging to network A, so the router routes it out of interface 1. Often, routers learn how to reach distant networks by exchanging information with their neighbouring routers and building their own routing tables. This exchange of information to learn about other networks is called a routing protocol.</p>
